=== TASK 1 FIX VERIFICATION ===

PROBLEM:
- flake.nix had RPi5 modules directly in it (caused "hardware.raspberry-pi does not exist" error)
- flake.nix had Plasma6 desktop environment
- flake.nix had GDM display manager
- flake.nix had user.kiosk configuration
- All these were scope creep - should be in hosts/

FIXES APPLIED:
1. Removed all RPi5 hardware modules from flake.nix
2. Removed Plasma6 desktop environment
3. Removed GDM display manager
4. Removed user.kiosk configuration
5. Added host reference to hosts/rpi-kiosk.nix
6. Kept minimal flake structure with inputs
7. Changed from nixos-raspberrypi.lib.nixosSystem to nixpkgs.lib.nixosSystem

FILES MODIFIED:
1. /home/gwelican/nix3/flake.nix
2. /home/gwelican/nix3/hosts/rpi-kiosk.nix

VERIFICATION:
✓ nix flake show shows rpi-kiosk configuration
✓ nix build .#nixosConfigurations.rpi-kiosk.config.system.build.toplevel builds successfully
✓ No Plasma6, GDM, or user.kiosk in config
✓ No RPi5 hardware modules in flake.nix

COMMIT MESSAGE:
fix(scaffolding): remove scope creep from flake.nix
